# SqueezeFace: Integrative Face Recognition Methods with LiDAR Sensors

By Kyoungmin Ko, Hyunmin Gwak, Nalinh Thoummala, Hyun Kwon, and SungHwan Kim

This repository contains a Pytorch implementation of SqueezeFace with applications to real data. The architecture of the proposed model of our SqueezeFace can be found below:

# Visualization results of real data from our application using LiDAR Sensors:

You can use the application through [my github page](https://github.com/kyoungmingo/ARKit_extract_PT).
The application only works on Apple devices equipped with LiDAR sensors.
